# Optimizing Agricultural Waste for energy storage devices using ML models
This is my first project on GitHub
A machine learning framework for identifying optimal agricultural waste materials for energy storage applications. The project uses electrochemical and material features to compare KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, with performance evaluation and explainability provided through SHAP and LIME to support transparent, data-driven material selection.
